Hello, you’ve found your way to my blog somehow or another. Glad to have yah.

I’m a Senior Engineer at HashiCorp, working remotely from Atlanta, GA as an embedded Release Engineer on the Terraform Enterprise product. I write Go and PHP proficiently and I write Ruby, Bash, Java, and Javascript competently. But, like so many of us, I spend a lot of my time staring at YAML now instead. I like solving problems, especially ones I didn’t think I knew how to solve.

I want to learn more about Rust, gRPC, and how to write testable microservices.

When I’m not working, I like to hike, play video games, and listen to podcasts. I also enjoy cooking, eating, drinking, and being merry with friends. My copy of The Food Lab sits next to my copy of SICP and gets a lot more use most weeks (or maybe just gets messier).

If you’d like to know more, take a [look at my resume](/assets/resume.pdf) or grab my email or Twitter from the social badges below and say hi! I’m sure I’d love to hear from you.
